👋 Hi, its Oscar-Development here, but you can call me Oscar 😎

👀 I’m into making virtual worlds more awesome, one line of code at a time.

🌱 Currently on a journey to master Python while cooking up some wild ideas for FiveM.

💞️ I’m all about teaming up on wild and wacky FiveM projects that blow minds!

📫 Wanna chat? Hit me up on Discord (username: hsoscar or join Discord server: https://discord.gg/rrwAGe2wmU) for a good laugh or to talk serious dev stuff.

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know I once coded a llama into a game just for kicks? 🦙

The Lowdown:

🛠️ Projects: Right now, I'm neck-deep in crafting crazy cool stuff for FiveM servers. Front-end, back-end, you name it!

🎓 Skills: I rock at Lua for FiveM, making flashy HTML designs, and conjuring up custom CSS and JavaScript tricks.

💼 Experience: Been hacking away at FiveM since 2018. Yeah, I've seen things. Crazy, beautiful things.

💬 Chit-Chat: If you wanna brainstorm or just shoot the breeze, Discord's the place to find me.

🔧 Troubleshooting: When stuff breaks, I break it down and keep tweaking until it works then put it all back together long 🚬💨 Persistence is key!

🌐 Online HQ: No fancy website yet, but you can catch all my coding capers right here on GitHub.
